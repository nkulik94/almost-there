# Meet the Kuliks!

I did it!
I have successfully built my first website, and while it's hardly very sophisticated I am quite proud of it, given my lack of experience. Working on the code for the memory game was incredibly difficult at times, as I seemed to run into problems with every step. I'm glad I stuck with it, because it helped me gain a more intuitive understanding of how JavaScript works than I could have gotten from just learning and practicing alone.
Here's a brief explanation about how everything works:
The main page is simple HTML and CSS, styled how I thought it looked best with the resources and knowledge at my disposal. Although there is a script file linked to the HTML document, it is empty as I have chosen not to make this page interactive, at least for now.
Now for the memory game. There is one script file, linked to index.html, that contains all of the code that makes the game work.
